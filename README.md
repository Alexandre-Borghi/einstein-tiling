# Einstein tiling visualization

**DISCLAIMER: This is still work in progress.**

Visualization of the "hat" aperiodic monotile tiling discovered by
David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan and Chaim
Goodman-Strauss. Link to the paper:
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798>.

This is a WebAssembly web app built in Rust. The latest version is
hosted here: <https://einstein.demos.aborghi.fr>.

## Development

### Dependencies

Before building the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- [The Rust programming
  language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

  After installing `rustup`, you will need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain. For this, run:

  ```
  $ rustup toolchain install wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

- [wasm-bindgen-cli](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/reference/cli.html)

  To install, run:

  ```
  $ cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli
  ```

### Building

This has been tested on Linux but will normally work on any Unix-like
OS. On Windows you'll have to either use WSL or replicate the steps
from `build.sh` manually.

To build, run the build script:

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

The generated files are placed in the `docs` folder.

**Warning**: the `docs` folder isn't entirely generated by the build
script. Only `einstein_tiling_bg.wasm` and `einstein_tiling.js`
are. So don't delete the entire `docs` folder.

### Running

After building, the `docs` folder can be served using any web
server. If you don't have any, I recommend
[`static-web-server`](https://static-web-server.net/) for development.
